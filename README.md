# To-do-list

Here is my to-do list project! I used MDB library for the interface, Jquery(Ajax) for communicating with backend.
In this webpage you can add a new record, edit already existing one, delete records or mark as completed, clear 
the completed ones and choose which records( completed or uncompleted) should be displayed.
